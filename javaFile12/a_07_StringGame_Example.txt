/*
In this example we chose a random word from the file "WordFile1.txt" 
and display it on the screen
We don't need to know how many words are in the file. We open the 
file first, count how many lines are there and
use this number in order to generate a random number 
from 1 to the number Every time we run the programm, a random 
number is generated and a word is displayed
